bayesT
======
- T-test using Bayes regularization of standard deviation
- This function applies the bayes estimate of the variance to analyse high density control+experiment array data
- usage: bayesT(aData, numC, numE, ppde=TRUE, betaFit=1, bayes=TRUE, winSize=101, conf=10)
	+ aData: A data frame containing microarray data in the form of control and experiment replicates
	+ numC: The number of control data columns
	+ numE: The number of experiment data columns
	+ ppde: A logical indicating whether the PPDE test should be performed
	+ betaFit: The number of beta's in the mixture model fit, can be 1,2 or 3
	+ bayes: A logical indicating whether the bayes t-test should be performed if FALSE, then the standard t-test 
is applied
	+ winSize: The window size specifying now many neighbouring genes' mean expression values will be pooled to 
obtain the background variance. See 'details'.
	+ conf:	The number of 'pseudocounts' giving weight to the prior variance. See 'details'.

- Details
	+ Input data will NOT be transformed (log etc.) so please perform all transformations prior to calling bayesT. 
Zeros in the data
will be considered as valid inputs. "NA" in the data are considered missing values and will be ignored accordingly. 

	+ winSize: It indicates how wide you want the window surrrounding the point 
under consideration to be. This sample of the data provides an estimate of the average variability of 
gene expression for those genes that show a similar expression level. It is important to 
estimate this average from a wide enough level that it is accurate, but not so wide of a window 
so as to average in genes with too different an average expression level. A sliding window of 101 genes 
has been shown to be quite accurate when analyzing 2000 or more genes, with only 1000 genes a 
window of 51 genes may work better.

	+ conf: This number is >=0 and indicates the weight give to the Bayesian prior estimate of within-treatment 
variance. 
Larger weights indicate greater confidence in the Bayesian prior; smaller weights indicate more confidence in the 
experimentally observed variance. We have observed 
reasonable performance with this parameter set equal to approximately 3 times the number of 
experimental observations, when the number of experimental observations is small (approximately 4 or less). 
If the number of replicate experimental observations is large then the confidence value can be lowered 
to be equal to the number of replicates (or even less).

- Value
  Returns a numeric matrix giving the summary statistics, bayes t-test and ppde results, if wanted

bayesT.pair
===========
- T-test using Bayes regularization of variance
- This function applies the bayes estimate of the variance to analyse high density paired (e.g. Cy3/Cy5) array data
- Usage: bayesT.pair(aData, doLog=TRUE, numR, ppde=TRUE, betaFit=1, bayes=TRUE, winSize=101, conf=10)
	+ aData: A data frame containing microarray data in the form of replicated ratio columns 
and an "estimated total expression" column. See 'details'.
	+ doLog: A logical indicating whether the data should be ln-transformed. This function requires ln-transformed 
data. 
Hence if it is not ln-transformed, then doLog should be set to TRUE.
	+ numR: The number of ratio (e.g. Cy3/Cy5) data columns
	+ ppde: A logical indicating whether the PPDE test should be performed
	+ betaFit: The number of beta's in the mixture model fit, can be 1,2 or 3
	+ bayes: A logical indicating whether the bayes t-test should be performed, 
if FALSE, then the standard t-test is applied
	+ winSize: The window size specifying now many neighbouring genes' mean expression values will be pooled
to obtain the background variance. See 'details'.
	+ conf:	The number of 'pseudocounts' giving weight to the prior variance. See 'details'.

-Details
	+ Estimated total expression: The "estimated total expression" column should 
be the last column in the dataset. 
Since paired (ratio) data lack the absolute expression data needed 
to calculate the Bayesian estimate of variance, the user needs to provide 
an estimate if you want to use the Bayesian calculation. 
Assume the following experiment in which the data below are 
the background-corrected scan values:

     Column that you have to calculate-----------------+
                                                       |

Sum      11740   4757   9361 | 12002   9568  14129 

The extra column of values that would have to be calculated FOR EACH GENE would be as follows:
(sum( ln(61/11740) +  ln(26/4757) + ... +  ln(45/12002) + ln(50/14129) )) / 6

The column marked 'estExpr' needs to be computed by the user and 
must be the last column in the dataset after the ratio columns.

runAllBayesAnova
================
- A wrapper for calling bayesAnova, postHoc, ppdeMix, and runMulttest
- See the respective functions for their details


bayesAnova
==========
- Runs a Bayes-regularized F-test (a one-way ANOVA) on multiple condition data
- aData - actual data frame organized as cond1-1, cond1-2, ..., condN-1, condN-2, ..., condN-M
- numVec - is a vector describing how many columns per condition.  If there are 3 samples of condition 1, 
  4 samples of condition 2, and 5 samples of condition 3 (12 columns total), then numVec should be:
  c(3, 4, 5)
- Rest of the parameters are analogous to the bayesT parameters.

- Runs TukeyHSD or Scheffe's pairwise posthoc tests.
- aovData - is the base data returned from bayesAnova
- numVec - like bayesAnova call
- postTest
  - T for TukeyHSD
  - S for Scheffe's
